# Firewall guard

This applet guards a firewall by notifying on a Das Keyboard Q series if some port in a port range 
are not at the expected status UP or DOWN.

The key will blink in RED if one of the ports does not have the correct status.
The key will stay green if every port of the range has the right status.
